# Levery Whitepaper

## Abstract

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/splash.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Levery is a decentralized exchange (DEX) initiative designed to bridge the compliance gap between traditional financial institutions and the growing DeFi market. Leveraging **Uniswap V4 hook** functionalities and adhering to stringent AML, KYC, and compliance frameworks, Levery ensures **traditional financial institutions can engage in DeFi** transactions securely. By implementing dynamic fees, integrating advanced market prices oracles and carrying out robust price comparisons, Levery **mitigates impermanent loss** and **maximizes liquidity returns**, ensuring increased earnings for liquidity providers while maintaining competitive pricing for swappers. This system provides a compliant, profitable, and secure environment for financial institutions to exploit DeFi opportunities without compromising regulatory obligations.

{% hint style="info" %}
Levery was developed during the **Uniswap Hook Incubator** / HOOKATHON Cohort 1, an 8-week program by Atrium Academy aimed at advancing DeFi development through Uniswap V4's hooks. Supported by a grant from the **Uniswap Foundation**, this initiative helps developers like the Levery team build enhanced DeFi solutions.
