# Levery Whitepaper

## Abstract

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/splash.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Levery** is a decentralized exchange (DEX) infrastructure protocol designed to bridge the compliance gap between traditional financial institutions and the decentralized finance (DeFi) market. Leveraging **Uniswap V4 hook** functionalities and adhering to stringent **AML**, **KYC**, and **compliance frameworks**, Levery ensures financial institutions can engage in DeFi transactions securely. By integrating reliable market price oracles, carrying out pool price comparisons and implementing dynamic fees to adjust the pool price with the market price, Levery mitigates impermanent loss and maximizes liquidity returns, ensuring increased fees for liquidity providers while maintaining competitive pricing for swappers. This system provides a compliant, profitable, and secure environment for financial institutions to exploit DeFi opportunities without compromising regulatory obligations.

{% hint style="info" %}
Levery was developed during the **Uniswap Hook Incubator** / HOOKATHON Cohort 1, an 8-week program by Atrium Academy aimed at advancing DeFi development through Uniswap V4's hooks. Supported by a grant from the **Uniswap Foundation**, this initiative helps developers like the Levery team build enhanced DeFi solutions.
