# Levery Whitepaper

## Abstract

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/splash.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Levery infrastructure allows banks and financial institutions to create their own digital assets exchange using AMM technology. It is a decentralized exchange (DEX) infrastructure designed to bridge the compliance gap between traditional financial institutions and the burgeoning DeFi market. By leveraging Automated Market Maker technology and advanced market price oracles, Levery ensures that financial institutions can engage in DeFi transactions securely, while adhering to stringent AML, KYC, and compliance frameworks.

By integrating reliable market price oracles, carrying out pool price comparisons and implementing dynamic fees to adjust the pool price with the market price, Levery mitigates impermanent loss and maximizes liquidity returns, ensuring increased fees for liquidity providers while maintaining competitive pricing for swappers. This system provides a compliant, profitable, and secure environment for financial institutions to exploit DeFi opportunities without compromising regulatory obligations.
