## Levery Enables DEFI for Financial Institutions

Levery presents a structured platform designed for financial institutions to engage with DeFi markets. By addressing critical challenges and utilizing advanced technologies, Levery enhances profitability, ensures regulatory compliance, and mitigates risks associated with decentralized finance. The key advantages include:

### Regulatory Compliance

Designed with stringent AML and KYC frameworks, Levery enables financial institutions to participate in DeFi without compromising on compliance. This ensures that all operations on the platform meet global regulatory standards, making it a viable and attractive option for institutional investors.

### Elimination of Counterparty Risk

Levery’s decentralized nature eliminates the counterparty risk associated with centralized exchanges (CEXs). By removing the need to trust a single entity, Levery ensures that transactions are secure and transparent. This addresses the concerns raised by the history of fraud and insolvency seen in some CEXs, such as the collapse of FTX.

### Mitigation of Impermanent Loss and Toxic Arbitrage

Levery enhances profitability for liquidity providers by leveraging Uniswap V4's hooks to implement dynamic fees based on real-time data from price feed oracles. These oracles supply crucial market price information, allowing for precise adjustments of dynamic fees to maintain fair pricing and mitigate toxic arbitrage risks. This mechanism optimizes returns on investments for liquidity providers and significantly reduces the impact of impermanent loss by ensuring that pool prices reflect current market conditions.

### Advantages for Swappers

Levery ensures that traders, or swappers, continue to benefit from competitive prices when trading in Levery pools. The platform mitigates toxic arbitrages, which can lead to significant losses for liquidity providers, but allows regular arbitrages to occur. This selective mitigation ensures that liquidity providers are protected from harmful arbitrages while still enabling swappers to capitalize on arbitrage opportunities. Consequently, Levery maintains an attractive trading environment for both liquidity providers and swappers, balancing profitability and market efficiency.

### Secure and Transparent Environment

The use of comprehensive identity checks and permission management systems guarantees a secure trading environment where all participants are verified. This transparency builds trust and facilitates smoother transactions, attracting more institutional participants to the platform.
