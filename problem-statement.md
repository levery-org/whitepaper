# Problem Statement

## Compliance Challenges in DeFi for Traditional Financial Institutions

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) represent a significant shift from traditional financial ecosystems, primarily due to their foundational principles of anonymity and lack of centralized control. While these features are celebrated for promoting financial inclusivity and privacy, they pose significant compliance challenges for traditional financial institutions. These institutions are bound by stringent regulatory frameworks, which mandate thorough Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, designed to prevent financial crimes such as fraud, terrorism financing, and money laundering.

The inherently anonymous nature of transactions on most DEXs stands in stark contrast to these compliance requirements. Without identity verification mechanisms, it becomes nearly impossible for financial institutions to ensure that their services are not misused for illicit activities. This lack of compliance infrastructure not only exposes these institutions to potential legal and reputational risks but also limits their ability to engage with these innovative markets without breaching regulatory standards. Furthermore, the decentralized nature of these platforms disperses the responsibility for regulatory adherence across all participants, which complicates the enforcement of compliance standards.

Consequently, there is a crucial need for mechanisms that bridge the gap between the Automated Market Maker (AMM) solution from DEXs and the regulatory requirements of traditional financial markets. These mechanisms must provide robust identity verification and compliance checks that align with global financial regulations, while still respecting the decentralized ethos of the blockchain space.

## Impermanent Loss in DEX Pools

Impermanent loss is a pervasive risk for liquidity providers (LPs) in decentralized exchanges (DEXs), primarily arising from the unique way these platforms manage asset liquidity. Impermanent loss occurs when the relative price of the assets in a liquidity pool changes after they are deposited, and it can be intensified by several factors, including price latency, toxic arbitrage, and the general volatility of the cryptocurrency market.

### Toxic Arbitrage

Toxic arbitrage refers to arbitrage trading that, rather than aligning prices and adding efficiency to the market, actually extracts value from liquidity providers. Arbitrageurs can exacerbate the effects of price latency by systematically exploiting these inefficiencies, which can significantly increase the impermanent loss for unsuspecting LPs. This form of arbitrage is particularly harmful in pools with high price volatility and slow update mechanisms.

### Price Latency

DEXs can not instantaneously reflect live market prices. Due to their decentralized nature, DEXs do not update prices instantaneously like centralized exchanges (CEXs). Instead, prices in a DEX are determined by the ratios of assets in liquidity pools, and these ratios change as traders add or remove liquidity or execute trades. Price updates in a DEX pool often lag behind those in more centralized markets due to the decentralized nature of blockchain confirmations and updates. This latency can be exploited by arbitrageurs who use sophisticated strategies and faster trading systems to buy assets at a lower price on a DEX and sell them at a higher price on a real-time exchange, effectively removing value from the liquidity pool.

### Correlation Divergence

In addition to these factors, the divergence in correlation between paired assets in a liquidity pool can also contribute to impermanent loss. Ideally, the paired assets should maintain a relatively stable price relationship. However, if one asset suddenly becomes less correlated due to external market factors or changes in tokenomics, it can cause disproportional shifts within the pool, leading to greater financial exposure for LPs.

### Slippage

Slippage in the DEX occurs when there is a difference between the expected price of a trade and the executed price. High slippage often occurs in pools with low liquidity or during periods of high trading volume. This can affect the stability of the pool and exacerbate impermanent loss as LPs may receive less value for their provided liquidity than expected.

Addressing these problems requires sophisticated solutions that can align DEX functionalities with the needs of liquidity providers and regulatory requirements of financial institutions. By implementing real-time oracle data for accurate price feeds and leveraging Uniswap V4's hook features to to dynamically adjust of fees based on market conditions, and improved algorithms for balancing pool assets, Levery aim to safeguard investments and ensure compliance, thereby fostering a more stable and trustworthy DeFi ecosystem.

## Counterparty Risk in Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)

Financial institutions face significant risks when dealing with centralized exchanges (CEXs), particularly due to counterparty risk and the history of fraud associated with some exchanges. High-profile incidents, such as the collapse of FTX and other exchanges, have highlighted the vulnerabilities inherent in centralized systems.

### Counterparty Risk

When financial institutions engage in transactions through CEXs, they are exposed to the risk that the counterparty might default on their obligations. This risk is heightened by the lack of transparency in the operations of some CEXs, making it difficult to assess the financial health and integrity of the exchange.

### History of Fraud and Insolvency

The history of fraud and insolvency in CEXs has led to significant financial losses for users. Incidents like the FTX collapse underscore the dangers of relying on centralized entities that may engage in fraudulent activities or face liquidity crises. These events erode trust and highlight the need for decentralized solutions that mitigate such risks.
