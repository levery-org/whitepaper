# Problem Statement

### **Compliance Challenges in DeFi for Traditional Financial Institutions**

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) represent a significant shift from traditional financial ecosystems, primarily due to their foundational principles of anonymity and lack of centralized control. While these features are celebrated for promoting financial inclusivity and privacy, they pose significant compliance challenges for traditional financial institutions. These institutions are bound by stringent regulatory frameworks, which mandate thorough Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, designed to prevent financial crimes such as fraud, terrorism financing, and money laundering.

The inherently anonymous nature of transactions on most DEXs stands in stark contrast to these compliance requirements. Without identity verification mechanisms, it becomes nearly impossible for financial institutions to ensure that their services are not misused for illicit activities. This lack of compliance infrastructure not only exposes these institutions to potential legal and reputational risks but also limits their ability to engage with these innovative markets without breaching regulatory standards. Furthermore, the decentralized nature of these platforms disperses the responsibility for regulatory adherence across all participants, which complicates the enforcement of compliance standards.

Consequently, there is a crucial need for mechanisms that bridge the gap between the autonomy of DeFi and the regulatory requirements of traditional financial markets. These mechanisms must provide robust identity verification and compliance checks that align with global financial regulations, while still respecting the decentralized ethos of the blockchain space.

### **The Risk of Impermanent Loss Due to Price Latency and Toxic Arbitrage**

Impermanent loss is another significant challenge in DeFi, particularly affecting liquidity providers on DEXs. This form of loss occurs when the price of assets in a liquidity pool diverges significantly from the prices at the time they were deposited. The greater the divergence, the more severe the impermanent loss, which can erode the returns on investment for liquidity providers.

A key factor contributing to impermanent loss is the latency in price updates within the pools compared to more synchronous centralized exchanges. Price latency arises because decentralized exchanges do not instantaneously reflect market price changes. This delay can be exploited through toxic arbitrage strategies where arbitrageurs take advantage of the differences in price between slower updating DEXs and faster, more synchronized markets. These strategies not only harm the profits of honest liquidity providers but also destabilize the pricing mechanisms of the DEXs themselves.

Toxic arbitrage exacerbates impermanent loss by accelerating the rate at which prices in a liquidity pool become outdated or misaligned with real-world trading values. This issue is compounded by the high volatility of cryptocurrency markets, where prices can change rapidly and significantly within minutes. Consequently, without real-time price adjustments or mechanisms to mitigate these discrepancies, liquidity providers face a higher risk of loss, and the overall efficiency and attractiveness of DEXs are diminished.

Addressing these problems requires sophisticated solutions that can align DEX functionalities with the needs of liquidity providers and regulatory requirements of financial institutions. By implementing real-time data feeds and dynamic pricing adjustments, platforms like Levery aim to safeguard investments and ensure compliance, thereby fostering a more stable and trustworthy DeFi ecosystem.
