### Traditional Financial Institutions and DeFi Challenges

The rapid expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) presents unprecedented opportunities for asset management and investment. However, this innovation is not without its challenges, particularly for traditional financial institutions.&#x20;

Two primary concerns hinder broader adoption: the risk of impermanent loss due to toxic arbitrage and the lack of compliance mechanisms tailored to the regulated nature of these institutions. The anonymity inherent in existing DEXs and the latency in market price reflection exacerbate these issues, often resulting in suboptimal outcomes for liquidity providers (LPs) and deterring regulated entities from participating in the DeFi space.

To address these challenges, Levery integrates the cutting-edge hook features of Uniswap V4 with a suite of compliance tools that include AML and KYC verification processes. At the core of Levery’s solution is a sophisticated oracle system that provides real-time market data, facilitating the comparison of fair market prices with those on the liquidity pool. This comparison is critical in adjusting transaction fees dynamically — minimizing impermanent loss, and ensuring that LPs receive optimal returns on their investments.
